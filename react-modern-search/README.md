## Web Parts Configuration

### Search Box Web Part

<p align="center"><img width="300px" src="./images/sb_property_pane.png"/><p>

#### Default Search Query Settings

Setting | Description
-------|----
Use a dynamic data source | You can set a default query text coming from am other data source. This case is particularly useful when you want to put a search box Web Part on the front page redirecting to an other page with the same query. Use the query string parameter 'q' from the built-in 'Page Environment' data source.

#### Search box options

Setting | Description
-------|----
Enable query suggestions | The search box supports query suggestions from SharePoint. Refer to the following [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/search/manage-query-suggestions) to know how to add query suggestions in your SharePoint tenant (caution: it can take up to 24h for changes to take effect).
Send the query to a new page | Sends the search query text to a new page. On that page, use an other search box Web Part configured with a dynamic data source as the default query. This Web Part uses the URL fragment '#' to pass the entered keywords. Make sure you use this data source property in your targeted components to retrieve the query.
Placeholder text | The placeholder text to display in the search box.

#### Search query enhancement

Setting | Description
-------|----
Use Natural Language Processing service | Turn this option 'on' if you want to enhance the query text with NLP services like LUIS. In the _'Service Url'_ field, enter the URL of the Azure Function endpoint. Refer the instructions in the `'/functions/README.md'` file to set up the service. In this sample, only relevant detected keywords are returned as q new query using LUIS. Enabling debug mode will show you relevant information about the entered query.

    </td>
  </tr>
<table>

#### Search Query Configuration

Setting | Description
-------|----
Search query keywords | Here you choose to use a static search query or a query coming from a data source. It is recommended to use the associated Web Part coming with this sample. The search query is in KQL format so you can use search query variables (See this [post](http://www.techmikael.com/2015/07/sharepoint-rest-do-support-query.html) to know which ones are allowed). You can only plug one source to this Web Part.

<p align="center"><img width="300px" src="./images/wp_connection.png"/><p>

#### Search Settings

Setting | Description
-------|----
Query template | The search query template in KQL format. You can use search variables here (like Path:{Site}).
Result Source Identifier | The GUID of a SharePoint result source.
Sort order | The initial search results sort order, where you can use one or multiple properties to sort by. **By default, results are sorted by created date (ascending) and size (descending). Remove these values to reset default sorting**
Sortable fields | The search managed properties to use for sorting. With SharePoint Online, you have to reuse the default ones to do so (RefinableStringXX etc.). The order is the same as they will appear in the sort panel. You can also provide your own custom labels using the following format RefinableString01:"You custom filter label",RefinableString02:"You custom filter label",... If no sortable fields are provided, the 'Sort' button will not be visible.
Connect to a search refiners Web Part | If enable, select the search refiners Web Part to use on the current page to get selected filters. It is a 2 ways connection so don't forget to connect the targeted search refiners to the search results Web Part as well.
Connect to a search verticals Web Part | If enable, select the search verticals Web Part to connect to.
Enable Query Rules | Enable the query rules if applies. Turn this options  'on' to display your SharePoint Promoted results (links only) and make result blocks available to custom renderers.
Include OneDrive results | Include OneDrive results if applicable. Turn this option 'on' to make users' personal OneDrive results available to custom renderers. Read more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/support/search/private-onedrive-results-not-included).
Selected properties | The search managed properties to retrieve. You can select them from a predefined list or add them as free text if not listed. Then, these properties are available in your Handlebars template with the syntax (`item.property_name` or `property_name` inside the `{{#each}}` loop).
Number of items to retrieve per page | Quite explicit. The paging behavior is done directly by the search API (See the *SearchDataProvider.ts* file), not by the code on post-render.

#### Styling Options

Setting | Description
-------|----
Web Part Title | Shows a title for this Web Part. Set blank if you don't want a title.
Show blank if no result | Shows nothing if there is no result
Show result count | Shows the result count and entered keywords
Connect to a search pagination Web Part	 | If enable, select the search pagination Web Part to use on the current page to get selected page. It is a 2 ways connection so don't forget to connect the targeted search pagination to the search results Web Part as well.
Result Layouts options | Choose the template to use to display search results. Some layouts are defined by default but you can create your own either by clicking on the **"Custom"** tile, or **"Edit template"** from an existing chosen template. In custom mode, you can set an external template. It has to be in the same SharePoint tenant. Behind the scenes, the Office UI React controls are used. Custom code templates will also automatically be displayed here upon registration. See the [TEMPLATING.md documentation](./docs/TEMPLATING.md) for more information about templating.
Result types | Allows you to set a custom template at item level according to a specific condition (ex: FileType equals 'pdf').

##### Miscellaneous: Taxonomy values dynamic translation

The search results Web Part supports automatic translation for taxonomy based filters and result metadata according to current site language. To get it work, you must map a new refinable managed property associated with *ows_taxId_<your_column_name>* crawled property and turn on the *'Localization Enabled'* toggle in the search results property pane:

</p>

### Search Refiners

<p align="center"><img width="300px" src="./images/search-refiners-property-pane.png"/><p>

#### Refiner Options

Setting | Description
-------|----
Refiners | The search managed properties to use as refiners. Make sure these are refinable. With SharePoint Online, you have to reuse the default ones to do so (RefinableStringXX etc.). The order is the same as they will appear in the refinement panel. You can also provide your own custom labels using the following format RefinableString01:"You custom filter label",RefinableString02:"You custom filter label",... This Web Part supports dynamic translation of taxonomy based refiners with few additional configurations in the connected search results Web Part (see above).
Connect to search results Web Part | The search results Web Part to use on the current page to get filters.

#### Styling Options

Setting | Description
-------|----
Web Part Title | Shows a title for this Web Part. Set blank if you don't want a title.
Show blank if no result | Shows nothing if there is no filter
Filters layout | Choose the template to use to display filters results.

### Search Pagination

<p align="center"><img width="300px" src="./images/search-pagination-property-pane.png"/><p>

#### Pagination Options

Setting | Description
-------|----
Connect to search results Web Part | The search results Web Part to use on the current page to get page.

### Search Navigation Webpart
This addition is a pivot-navigation link list that may be used to emulate the navigation in the out-of-the-box search center. You can use this webpart on several different pages and set up a searchbox and refiners webpart to handle different types of result. The webpart will automatically detect if it is on the right page from the set of navigation nodes, and display it in the preferred color.
<img src="./images/NavNodesMain.gif">

#### Connect to a source
In order to make the search go between the pages where you have set up searches, use this functionality to connect to a search box on the current site. The query from this searchbox will be passed as a url parameter 'q' when navigating to the next page. This is done in the same manner as when you are connecting the search box webpart to the search refiners webpart.

#### Setup Navigation nodes
This step is used to set up the navigation nodes, and needs to be done on all pages it should be displayed on to work correctly.
<img src="./images/ChangeNode.gif">

#### Setup colors
The you may either use the site collection theme colors, or use a custom color you choose in the settings pane.
<img src="./images/ChangeColor.gif">

### Search Verticals Web Part

<p align="center"><img width="500px" src="./images/search_verticals.png"/><p>


The search verticals Web Part allow users to search through predefined scopes (i.e videos, people, etc.). The behavior is different from the search navigation Web Part because here, we simply replace the query template and result source dynamically for a chosen vertical. To get it work, you simply need to connect the search verticals Web Part to a search results Web Part using the associated option. Also, if you want to display counts for each verticals **when a new query is performed** (for instance a search box query or an URL fragment update), connect the search results Web Part to the search verticals one (two ways connection in this case).

#### Verticals Options

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
<p align="center"><img src="./images/search_verticals_propertypane.png"/><p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p align="center"><img src="./images/search_verticals_propertypane2.png"/><p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan=2>
<p align="center"><img src="./images/search_verticals_propertypane3.png"/><p>
    </td>
  </tr>
<table>


Setting | Description
-------|----
Search verticals | Configure the search verticals to display. When you set a query template or a result source id for a vertical, these override the ones in the connected search results. You can also set an icon for a vertical using [Office UI Fabric icons names](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/icons). The query keywords are shared across all verticals. For instance, if you need default results for tabs, just specify a default query in the connected search results Web Part (like `*`) and the `{searchTerms}` expression in your vertical query template. Also, selected refinement filters are reset, if present, when a new vertical is selected.
Show results count | Indicates if the results count should be displayed for each vertical. In this case, you need to connect the Web Part to an existing search results Web Part on the page.


## Features
This Web Part illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

- Build an user friendly search experience on the top of the SharePoint search REST API with paging, refiners and query suggestions using the *@pnp* JavaScript library.
- Use [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to create templates for search results according to your requirements like the good old display templates.
- Using the SPFx [dynamic data feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/dynamic-data) to connect Web Parts.
- Using SharePoint taxonomy using JSOM in SPFx (filter translations)
- Integrate the [@pnp/spfx-property-controls](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-property-controls) in your solution (*PlaceHolder* control).
- Integrate multiple Office UI Fabric components (DocumentCard, Panel, GroupedList, ...) to fit with the native Office 365 theme.
- Use the React container component approach inspiring by the [react-todo-basic sample](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-todo-basic)

## Important notice on upgrading the solution from pre v2.2.0.0
**Due to code restructuring we have hit an edge case which impacts upgrades from previous versions. To solve the issue go to `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<appcatalog>/Lists/ComponentManifests` and remove the entries for SearchBox and Search Results, and then upload the .sppkg for the new release.**

**Next you need to loop over all sites which have the web parts installed, and upgrade the App on those sites. Now the web parts should work on new and existing sites. You may use the PnP command `Update-PnPApp` to update the application.**

**If you have deployed the solution as a tenant wide extension, this should not impact you.**

## Important notice on upgrading the solution from pre v3.0.0.0

**Because this version introduces a new standalone search refiners Web Part, you will have to reconfigure all previous refiners from the search results Web Part to this new Web Part. You can get the previous layout for filters by selecting the 'Panel' layout in the new Web Part property pane.**
